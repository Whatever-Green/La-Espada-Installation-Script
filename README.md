# Minecraft Modded server installation script
This script hopes to simplify the installation of mods by checking if java is installed, installing forge and copying the relivent mods to the correct folders...
I would still recommend you install T-Launcher 
and just using this script to copy the relivent mods

---

To get started on download the repository by clicking the green "Code" button and clicking "Download as Zip"

---

If you have already downloaded the Repo; on windows double click the "install" file, it should then open a window where the installation will take place

If you are unsure about anything please contact

Thanks
